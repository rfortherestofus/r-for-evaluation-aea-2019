# Load Packages

Let's load the `tidyverse` package.  

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

# Import NHANES Data

Let's import our data using `read_csv`. Note that the NHANES data is in the data directory so we need to include that.

```{r}
nhanes <- read_csv("data/nhanes.csv")
```

Let's see what our data looks like.

```{r}
nhanes
```



# select

![](slides/images/select.png)

With `select` we can select variables from the larger data frame.

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  select(age)
```


We can also use `select` for multiple variables:

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  select(age, education)
```


We can `select` a range of columns using the var1:var2 pattern

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  select(phys_active:smoke_now)
```


We can drop variables using the -var format:


```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  select(-id)
```

We can drop a set of variables using the -(var1:var2) format:

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  select(-(id:age_decade))
```

# mutate

![](slides/images/mutate.png)

We use `mutate` we make new variables or change existing ones. 

We can use `mutate` in three ways:

Create a **new variable with a specific value**

```{r}
# Make country variable
nhanes %>% 
  mutate(country = "United States") %>% 
  select(country)
```


Create a **new variable based on other variables**

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  mutate(height_inches = height / 2.54) %>% 
  select(height, height_inches)
```

Change an **existing variable**

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  mutate(height = height / 2.54) %>% 
  select(height)
```



# A Brief Interlude

## Comparisons

```{r echo = FALSE}

tibble::tribble(
  ~Operator, ~Description, ~Usage,
  "<", "less than", "x < y",
  "<=", "less than or equal to", "x <= y",
  ">", "greater than", "x > y",
  ">=", "greater than or equal to", "x >= y",
  "==", "exactly equal to", "x == y",
  "!=", "not equal to", "x != y",
  "%in%", "group membership", "x %in% y",
)
```



# filter

![](slides/images/filter.png)

We use `filter` to choose a subset of observations.

We use `==` to filter all observations that meet the criteria.


```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  filter(gender == "female") %>% 
  select(gender)
```

We use `!=` to select all observations that don't meet the criteria.

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  filter(work != "Working") %>% 
  select(work)
```



We can use `%in%` to only include responses that much a group. 

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  filter(health_gen %in% c("Good", "Vgood", "Excellent")) %>% 
  select(health_gen)
```


We can chain together multiple `filter` functions. 

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  filter(gender == "male") %>% 
  filter(health_gen %in% c("Good", "Vgood", "Excellent")) %>% 
  select(gender, health_gen)
```


We can use `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `=>` for numeric data.

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  filter(age >= 50) %>% 
  select(age)
```




# summarize

![](slides/images/summarize.png)


With `summarize`, we can go from a complete dataset down to a summary.

We use these functions with `summarize`.

```{r echo = FALSE}
tibble::tribble(
  ~Description, ~Usage,
  "number", "n()",
  "sum", "sum(x)",
  "minimum", "min(x)",
  "maximum", "max(x)",
  "mean", "mean(x)",
  "median", "median(x)",
  "standard deviation", "sd(x)",
  "variance", "var(x)",
  "rank", "rank(x)"
)
```


Let's calculate the mean number of days in which respondents report being physically active.

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  summarize(mean_days_phys_active = mean(phys_active_days))
```

This doesn't work! Notice what the result is. 

We need to add `na.rm = TRUE` to tell R to drop `NA` values.

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  summarize(mean_days_phys_active = mean(phys_active_days,
                                         na.rm = TRUE))
```


We can have multiple arguments in each usage of `summarize`. Let's add the median along with the mean.

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  summarize(mean_days_phys_active = mean(phys_active_days,
                                         na.rm = TRUE),
            median_days_phys_active = median(phys_active_days,
                                             na.rm = TRUE),
            number_of_responses = n())
```




# group_by

![](slides/images/group-by.png)


`summarize` becomes truly powerful when paired with `group_by`, which enables us to perform calculations on each group. Let's calculate the mean number of active days for each year the survey was done.


```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  group_by(age_decade) %>%
  summarize(mean_active_days = mean(phys_active_days,
                                    na.rm = TRUE))
```

We can use `group_by` with multiple groups. Let's calculate the mean number of active days for each year the survey was done and for gender.

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  group_by(survey_yr, gender, education) %>% 
  summarize(mean_active_days = mean(phys_active_days,
                                    na.rm = TRUE))
```



# Create new data frames

Sometimes you want to save the results of your work to a new data frame. 

Let's say we want to get the average height in inches for women in various age groups.

This just displays the output:

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  filter(gender == "female") %>% 
  mutate(height_inches = height / 2.54) %>% 
  group_by(age_decade) %>% 
  summarize(mean_height_inches = mean(height_inches,
                                    na.rm = TRUE)) 
```

This assigns that output to a new data frame.

```{r}
female_height_by_age <- nhanes %>% 
  filter(gender == "female") %>% 
  mutate(height_inches = height / 2.54) %>% 
  group_by(age_decade) %>% 
  summarize(mean_height_inches = mean(height_inches,
                                    na.rm = TRUE)) 
```
